      Table of 9 is the only table whose digits sum is equal to the itself.
      Table      sum_of_digits
       9             9
       18            9(1+8)
       27            9(2+7)
       36            9(3+6)
      and so on till 90
      
      # Fact - 2:
      
      Pi may be defined as the ratio of perimeter of circle to its diameter having value 3.1428571428571428571 which is       discovered by AryaBhatta - The mathematian of India educated in Takshila University (one of the famous university       in the world at that time)
      
      # Fact - 3:
      
      Most of the objects or things or celetial bodies in this universe are in either circle shaped or sphere shaped as       in mathematics sphere is only shape which contains large volume and less area. Circle is 2-d example of sphere.
      
      # Fact - 4:
      
      Most of the things which we saw around us are in mathematical shape like stairs are example of arithimatic             progression  , water tank is an example of cylinder , room is of either cuboid or cube , tent or birthday cap are       of cone , cake pie is of radius-sector , beams are of lines , bowl is of hemi sphere , bucket is of frustum and         many more. 
      
      # Fact - 5:
      
      55 is the greatest number which can be represent by our hand's finger by doing 5 and 5 makes 55. And the greatest magic is that we can count only 10 numbers using our hand's finger and summation of first 10 natural numbers is 55.
      
      # Fact - 6 :
      
      Every number when multiplied by 9 then its sum of digits are also 9. like 2*9 = 18 whose sum of digit is 9 ,25 * 9 = 225 whose sum of digits are also 9. you can take any example. Wether its 3,4 or any number  

      # Fact - 7 :
      
      Transportation problem , cost problem or project expenditure problems are solved by linear equation which gives optimal solution mathematically and guide business man in which field he need to invest and what cost he need to invest which gives him maximum profit. The graph is plotted to and min/max points are found. There is no jugaad or satta in real world investment or optimization problems. 
      
      Below is the example of maximizing revenue problem :-
      
      ## Problem :-
      
      A producer has 30 and 17 units of labour and capital respectively  which he can use to producetwo types of goods X and Y. To produce one unit of X, 2 unit of labour and 3 unit of capital required. Similarly 3 unit of labour and 1 unit of capital are required to produce one unit of Y. if X and Y are priced at Rs. 100 and Rs. 120 per unit respectively  ,how should the producer use his resources to maximize the total revenue?
      
      ## Answer - 
      
      Suppose X goods are x and Y goods are y and z is total revenue. Then z will be -
      
                              z = 100x + 120y
      
      Now, maximum number of units of labour available are 30 and 17 . There equation will be - 
      
                              2x + 3y <= 30     ------------------> 1
                              3x + y <= 17      ------------------> 2
                              
                              where x >= 0 and y >= 0
                              
            Lets convert these linear inequalities with linera equation.
            
                  2x + 3y = 30   , 3x + y =17
                  
            Points for equation---->  1
            
            x      0      15
            y      10     0

            So, the points are (0,10) , (15 ,0)
            
            
            Points for equation ----------> 2
            
            x     0      17/3
            y     17      0
            
            So, the points are (0,17) , (17/3 , 0)
            
            After solving these two equations, there point of intersection point is (3, 8)
            
            These points form bounded graph with points (0,0),(0,10) , (17/3 , 0) , (3, 8) 
            
            Now, put these (x,y) values in maximum revenue equation which is z = 100x + 120y
            
            at point (0,0)  z = 0
               point (0,10)  z = 1200
               point (17/3 , 0)  z = 566.67
               point (3,8) z = 1260
               
               So , revenue is maximum  when producer obtaine 3 goods of type X and 8 types of type Y.
