# Fact-1:

Miss ADA Augusta Lovelace was the first person who design first algorithm of computer.

# Fact-2:

The first computer designed by engineers was of the size of a room and a bug entered into it and corrupt its software. That's why mistakes done by a programmer in program are called bugs.

# Fact-3:

C language is not the first language which is used for programing in later phases of 1970's . Before 'C' there was languages like fortran , algol etc which are used for programming purpose.

C is middle level language because it it uses system call to interact with hardware (so it's not a low level language) and it is not so much advance language providing abstract interfaces for functions like other language like python and java. It is functional procedure oriented language not following oops concept.

# Fact-4:

Windows Registory is an example of hierarchal database implemented in the form of tree having parent node and children nodes with siblings. 

# Fact-5:

Lift used in multistorayed buildings works on the C-Scan algorithm which is basically a disk scheduling algorithm in which head of disk first goes in on direction and complete its all requests given by the users and then move to another direction and start serving requests of other side without wasting time on serving served requests.

# Fact-6:

Most of the communicating devices like mobile , laptop , television , computers etc are made up of semi-conductor like silicon , germanium which lie in the middle of periodic table having properties of both metals and non- metals. 
Mostly silicon is used as it is found in aboundent amount on earth. This is the main reson why IT industries are commonly known as "SILICON VALLEY" in America(USA).

# Fact-7:-

It is totally illusion that while running a program , the whole program resides into RAM. If the size of program is greater than RAM's size then it is divided into pages resides in hard disk and on the basis of requirement they go into RAM of the computer. This is called swaping of pages and when a page go into RAM called swap in process and when it go from RAM to hard disk then it is called swap out process. 

# Fact-8:-

Due to the problem of searching in skewed tree as it takes O(n) time complexity , the concept of balance tree came in data-structures . Adelson Velskii and Landis tree and Red- Black trees are example of balance tree.

# Fact-9:-

The concept of circular queue came into data-structure to overcome the disadvantage of memory waste in queue.

# Fact-10:-

Database indexing is implemented using B or B+ trees data-structure.

# Fact-11:-

Quick sort is categarized under unstable sort.

# Fact-12:-

OR operation gives addition of two numbers and AND operation give product of two numbers.(It is correct if bits are not overflowed otherwise it will give wrong answer in computer as one register is of 8 bits)

# Fact-13:-

Google uses google boat and Microsoft uses bing boat to search the web pages upload on the internet. Boat is a software which searches the webpages on daily basis and do indexing of these pages. Google get paid by other companies to rank their pages first and lots of people visit them. Such type of softwares are also known as spider.
