Fact-1:

Miss ADA Augusta Lovelace was the first person who design first algorithm of computer.

Fact-2:

The first computer designed by engineers was of the size of a room and a bug entered into it and corrupt its software. That's why mistakes done by a programmer in program are called bugs.

Fact-3:

C language is not the first language which is used for programing in later phases of 1970's . Before 'C' there was languages like fortran , algol etc which are used for programming purpose.

C is middle level language because it it uses system call to interact with hardware (so it's not a low level language) and it is not so much advance language providing abstract interfaces for functions like other language like python and java. It is functional procedure oriented language not following oops concept.

Fact-4:

Windows Registory is an example of hierarchal database implemented in the form of tree having parent node and children nodes with siblings. 

Fact-5:

Lift used in multistorayed buildings works on the C-Scan algorithm which is basically a disk scheduling algorithm in which head of disk first goes in on direction and complete its all requests given by the users and then move to another direction and start serving requests of other side without wasting time on serving served requests.

Fact-6:

Most of the communicating devices like mobile , laptop , television , computers etc are made up of semi-conductor like silicon , germanium which lie in the middle of periodic table having properties of both metals and non- metals. 
Mostly silicon is used as it is found in aboundent amount on earth. This is the main reson why IT industries are commonly known as "SILICON VALLEY" in America(USA).
