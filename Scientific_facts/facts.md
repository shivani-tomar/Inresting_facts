# Fact-1:

Earth's shape is not round . Actually its elliptical having the 33mm difference between south pole and north pole.

# Fact-2:

Human body consist of 70 % water . If our body lacked with 1% water then we feel thirsty and if it is lacked with 10% then we die.

# Fact-3

## Facts about solar system :- 

Earth is the only planet where is life. Humans are trying to make Mars like Earth as scientists have seen some signs of life there.

Sun is 330330 times bigger than earth and earth have a radius of 6400km. That means sun's perimeter is about 13276623360 km.

The distance between Sun and Earth is 15 X 10^7 km (15 crore).

Mercuray is the smallest and hottest planet of our solar system.

Jupiter have maximum satelites in our solar system which are 30 and saturn have 28 natural satelites.

Our Earth have only one natural satelite which is moon.

Venus consist of sulphuric acid clouds and have size around equal to earth.

There is astroid belt between Mars and Jupiter which is spread around some kilometers.

Proxima century is the closest star to earth.

Sun's age is about 5 X 10^ 9 years and according to scientists calculations it is going to live 5 X 10^9 years more also.

Sun is a star and stationary.

NH3CONH3 (Amonium cynate) is the first compound on the earth which decomposes into urea and then CO2 , H2O and N2O. That's why Earth is suitable planet for life.

Saturn is the most beautiful planet in our solar system due to the rings revolving around it.

Pluto is the coolest planet of our solar system which presence was calculated by scientists before its discovery. And it is the only planet whose orbit crosses the orbit of Neptune.

Helica comet is seen after 70 year and last time it was seen in 1976.

Solar ecllipse always fall on dark night and lunar ecllipse always fall on full moon night.

The force which binds planets to sun and make them to revolve around it is centripetel force.

The gravity on moon is 1/6th of the gravity of earth.

# Fact - 4:-

An year may be defined as the time taken by the planet to revolve around sun (main star) which is 364.25 days in case of earth. That's why calenders get every 4th year as leap year.

A day may be defined as the time taken by the planet to revolve around its own axis which 24 hours in case of earth.

Every planet in the solar system have different measures of years and days and there are many solar system in our universe.
Due to many differences of measurement of time on different planet or star or any celestial object , concept of time travelling arises based on the concept of relativity.

# Fact - 5:-

Spacecraft and rockets needs to apply force to overcome gravitational force to go outside of earth's environment which is known as escape velocity whose minimum value is 11.2 km/h on earth. Even gravitational force is the weakest force in this world having value 6.67 X 10 ^ -11

# Fact - 6:-

Best and natural example of nuclear fusion reaction is sun in which following reaction occurs :- 

        1H1 + 1H1 -----> 2He4
        
where two hydrozen combine to form helium which produces a lots of energy and heat. This is the main reason sun is so much hot.

# Fact - 7:-

## Hubble's Law :-

According to hubble's law "Universe is expanding." 

But main question is how? If we apply law of conservation then nothing can be created neigther destroyed. Then what makes universe expanding.

Actually,  Hubble was right in his context. "Universe is expanding". Let me elaborate.

Suppose a bottle is half filled with water. we can imagine bottle as space and water as matter which is the universe according to hubble. If we give some heat to water then it will convert into gas and bottle is full of vapour and gas(matter expanding) as it expand itself to the space which is blank to acquire and liquid will finish slowly(converted into gas). same thing happen with the universe, when energy is applied to it, matter formed or deformed. in the starting of universe , there was only one big ball  which break into smaller one, when energy is applied on them and expand them selves in the free space.

This is the simple law given by hubble which is true that universe is expanding but matter is same only force of attarction and repulsion and deformation of matter occures. 


## Biological Facts :-

Plants only need frequency of light and heat to prepare their food through leaves where choloroplast pigment is responsible for food preparation.

Mitochondria is called energy house of cell.

Lysosom is called suicide cell as once it breaks out it digest whole cell.

Green house effect was discovered by june beptist furey which is "glass house trap the infra red rays which are responsible for heating it up". This phenomenon is used in cold side cities to grow vegetables and fruits. 

We suffer from typhoid due to salmonela tyfi bacteria which entered into our body and make us ill.

Malaria is spread by the female anafleze mosquito.

Adward Jener was the first person who find out chicken pox cause in 1796.

Virus cannot be destroyed but can be inactive in odd conditions and active in favours. That's why once they entered into the body cannot be out. Most of the allergies are caused by viruses . Even Rynovirus is the virus who cause bad cold.

## Environmental Facts : - 

Ozone layer depletion is more in Antartica even there is no one to pollute the air then why Ozone depletion is more in Antartica. This is because of the fact that hot air try to rise up and flow from hot places to cool places to get cold and polluted air is hot due to the mixing of poisionious gases like SO2 , CO2 , CFC's etc and this polluted air goes to Antartica as it is the coolest place on the earth and deplete the ozone layer situated in stratosphere of our environment between in the range 16km-25km.

## Artificial Rain :-

Can we make raining artificially ? Then the answer is "YES" . We need to know the process of raining so that we can create such type of conditions to rain artificially. So, now the question is how does rain? Let me explain it.

Due to the energy get in form of heat , water converted into vapours and rose up and the process is called vaporization and then due to cold environment it again converted into liquid form and heavy enough to sustain with air and fall down in form of water drops combinedly known as rain. This is only outer structure of raining process. What happened during the water rising up and falling down. What are the condition arises which convert them?

Actually , when water rose up in form of vapours(gas form) , then these vapours form clouds and these clouds are ionized i.e. having particular charge (either positive or negative) on them . When two oppositively charged clouds collide to each other then there is lightening and thunder (intensity depends on many parameters like how do they collide , what position they collide etc.). It's like when we make one live wire to another wire having opposite charge , then they spark with some noise. Same happens with clouds. When they collide they create lightening and thunder and get neutral charge and cool down, these vapours converted into water(liquid form) again and these drops fall down due to gravitational force which is called raining. 

Now, I hope you understand how we can create artificial raining.

### How could gas be ionozed :-

In the above fact , I told you that vapours(gas) form clouds which are ionized. Now, the question arise how they are ionized. Actually , when heat is given to the water , bonds between them are broken and converted into gas which are hydrozen and oxygen. When more heat is given to them , they loose and gain electron to get stable postion according to octet rule and become ionized having postive charge and negative charge.

### Chemical reation of rain :-

                H2O  ------heat------>  H2 (gas)  +O2 (gas)
                H2 -------heat------->   2 H+ (loose 2 electron)
                O2 -------heat-------->  2 O- (gain 2 elecrton)
                
                2H+  + O-  ---------->  H2O (rain)
