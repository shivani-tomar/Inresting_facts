# Fact-1:

Earth's shape is not round . Actually its elliptical having the 33mm difference between south pole and north pole.

# Fact-2:

Human body consist of 70 % water . If our body lacked with 1% water then we feel thirsty and if it is lacked with 10% then we die.

# Fact-3

## Facts about solar system :- 

Earth is the only planet where is life. Humans are trying to make Mars like Earth as scientists have seen some signs of life there.

Sun is 330330 times bigger than earth and earth have a radius of 6400km. That means sun's perimeter is about 13276623360 km.

The distance between Sun and Earth is 15 X 10^9 km.

Mercuray is the smallest and hottest planet of our solar system.

Jupiter have maximum satelites in our solar system which are 30 and saturn have 28 natural satelites.

Our Earth have only one natural satelite which is moon.

Venus consist of sulphuric acid clouds and have size around equal to earth.

There is astroid belt between Mars and Jupiter which is spread around some kilometers.

Proxima century is the closest star to earth.

Sun's age is about 500 X 10^ 9 years and according to scientists calculations it is going to live 500 X 10^9 years more also.

Sun is a star and stationary.

NH3CONH3 (Amonium cynate) is the first compound on the earth which decomposes into urea and then CO2 , H2O and N2O. That's why Earth is suitable planet for life.

A day may be defined as the time taken by the planet to revolve around its own axis which 24 hours in case of earth.

Every planet in the solar system have different measures of years and days and there are many solar system in our universe.
Due to many differences of measurement of time on different planet or star or any celestial object , concept of time travelling arises based on the concept of relativity.
